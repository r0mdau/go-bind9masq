go-dns-match
===============

This project aims to match domain names in logs from dictionnaries of well known domain names.

For example, dns queries from dns server Bind is a good candidate.

Ì€`update.sh` script is an easy way to fetch famous dictionnaries maintained by Toulouse 1 Capitole University.

`main.go` is the script in development.

## Todo
use array to store all domains for faster checks, triple for loop is not good...
